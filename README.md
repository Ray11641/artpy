# ARTPY
Adaptive Resonance Theory based neural networks for clustering written in Python.

# About
This repository provides adaptive resonance theory based neural networks for clustering. Adapative resonance theory is a neuro-cognitive theory developed to explain stable code development in brain for pattern recognition while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Several winner-takes-all neural models are developed based on the theory. These include but not limited FuzzyART, TopoART, and et cetera.

For a survey on the list of neural network models based on adaptive resonance theory please refer to the following.
